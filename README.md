## Bank API üí∞

This project is a REST API for a banking system, built with Go and Gin. It uses JWT for
authentication and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## Features 

Users can sign up, login, and perform various operations based on their access rights, including creation of bank
accounts with different currencies, money deposits/withdraws/transfers. All the transactions can be listed in history.

Some mock users and their bank accounts are added by default [here](https://github.com/DimaGitHahahab/bank-api/tree/main/migrations). 

## Running locally
